#My Journey into R!!

My current goal is to learn how to analyse data using R as it will be a module on my MSc in Psychology Research Methods.

I want to get ahead now while I have some spare time!(I also want to be the best at using R in my class!)

I have zero background in any type of computer programming and have never used R or Git before!

Looking forward to learning a new skill!! :D
